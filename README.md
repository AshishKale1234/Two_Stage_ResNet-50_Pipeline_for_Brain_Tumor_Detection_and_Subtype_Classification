# Two-Stage-ResNet50-Pipeline-for-Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Subtype-Classification
A two-stage deep learning pipeline using ResNet50 for automated brain tumor analysis from MRI. Stage 1 performs binary tumor detection, while Stage 2 classifies tumor subtype (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, normal). Includes Grad-CAM interpretability and a Streamlit-based diagnostic interface.
